# Transformers informations
## transformers units
The transformer_units is the number of units or neurons in the dense layers inside the transformer encoder. Specifically, in the provided code structure you mentioned in earlier queries, this value is used to determine:

    The dimensionality of the outputs of the multi-head attention mechanism.
    The size (number of neurons) of the feed-forward neural network layers within the transformer encoder.
